    "The Chipotle data set is from \"The Upshot\" column in The New York Times. It was chosen because the data is familiar, real-world, and relevant to many students. It allows students to analyze [the same dataset studied by a data scientist at The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/02/17/upshot/what-do-people-actually-order-at-chipotle.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "For project two, you will complete a serious of exercises exploring [order data from Chipotle](https://github.com/TheUpshot/chipotle), compliments of The New York Times's \"The Upshot.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For these exercises, you will be conducting basic exploratory data analysis on Chipotle's order data, looking to answer such questions as: \n",
    "  - How many orders are being made?\n",
    "  - What is the average price per order?\n",
    "  - How many different ingredients? \n",
    "  \n",
    "This process will help you practice your data analysis skills while becoming comfortable with Python (Pandas not required).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Project Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the questions above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from this file (preferably in markdown).\n",
    "2. A working solution to each problem.\n",
    "   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).\n",
    "3. Comments for all of your code.\n",
    "   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bonus**: In programming (and life), there may be multiple ways to solve a problem. After completing our challenges, go back and see if you can think of any other valid methods!\n",

    "## Rubric\n",
    "\n",

    "Score | Expectations\n",

    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Your instructor will explain how to submit your assignment. Typically, this is done either by:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Creating a repository in your github profile, hosting your materials, and sharing a link with your instructor. [or]\n",
    " - Forking the project repository, adding your solutions, and submitting a pull request back to the relevant repo.\n"
